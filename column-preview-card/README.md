## My process

First i make a design prototype in figma based in photos from the challenge. It was a very good practice to using figma.
After, I started the code by creating arquives and HTML structure in index.html
In the styles.css, I organized the style with variables that represent the defined colors. SO i followed the entire development process using the mobile-first workflow, where we build first for mobile and then for destkop.

### Build with

- HTML
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
